Reduce memory use for graphical chunk.
Type: Performance

Graphical chunk usses a massive amount of memmory when creating the meshes.
About 2 gig when creating a small world. When the graphics are finished
the memory goes back to 2Mib wich is quite okay IMO.Found this out by using 
Valgrind massif. The size when creating a graphical chunk should not need to
be much bigger than a normal chunk.

Reduce the voxel size to 2 bytes.

Type: Performance

Instead of storing the light values in 2 bytes, the can share by using 4 bits 
each. Need to use bitmasking and shifting to accomplish.
