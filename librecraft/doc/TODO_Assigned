Reduce the voxel size to 2 bytes.

Type: Performance

Instead of storing the light values in 2 bytes, the can share by using 4 bits 
each. Need to use bitmasking and shifting to accomplish.

###

Prevent the game from crashing when the player is looking outside the world,
that is, trying to access a cube not in range.

###

There might be some bad memory accesses. Valgrind crashes when it is run
with player.updatePhisics(). It seems it has something to do with acessing 
voxels.

###

Improve the HUD
Type: Feature

Add several building blocks so that the player can easily see wich he can 
change to by pressing the change buttons. The player can change in both 
directions and the currently selected one is highlighted by being extra large
and in the middel.
