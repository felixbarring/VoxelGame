Reduce memory use for graphical chunk.
Type: Performance

Graphical chunk usses a massive amount of memmory when creating the meshes.
About 2 gig when creating a small world. When the graphics are finished
the memory goes back to 2Mib wich is quite okay IMO.Found this out by using 
Valgrind massif. The size when creating a graphical chunk should not need to
be much bigger than a normal chunk.

###

Reduce the voxel size to 2 bytes.

Type: Performance

Instead of storing the light values in 2 bytes, the can share by using 4 bits 
each. Need to use bitmasking and shifting to accomplish.

###

Prevent the game from crashing when the player is looking outside the world,
that is, trying to access a cube not in range.

###

There might be some bad memory accesses. Valgrind crashes when it is run
with player.updatePhisics(). It seems it has something to do with acessing 
voxels.

###

Game crashes when looking at bedrock, vector out of bounds.
