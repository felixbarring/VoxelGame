###

Try out using clang tidy and clang format.

###

Loading 3D-models
Type: Feature

Create a demo showcasing how to load and render 3D models.

###

Reduce matrix multiplications
Type: Performance

Instead of doing one matrix multiplication for each chunk, do one
for several chunks. This requires some system to group the chunks
together and not using one modelspace for each chunk, but a 
shared one for all chunks thatt share the same matrix.

###

Tree structure
Type: Performance

Implement a tree structure to reduce the number of frustum cheks.
Each chunks gets placed in the tree as a child node. The parrent 
nodes all represent a volume. If the volume is not in the
frustum the child does not need to be checked. If it is inside the
frustum, then step into the next child node of the current node, 
which will have another node representing a volume, or a 
chunk. All chunks that are reached this way shall be rendered.


###

Make the water physics better:

Type: Improvement

Currently the speed in water feels very off. Should be improved
to feel more natural.

###

Shadow map demo
Type: Feature

Implement a demo showcasing shadow mapping on a simple sceen of 
cubes and a floor. The light source shall be a sun that moves 
and hence created moving shadows.

###

Bump mapping demo
Type: Feature

Implement a demo showcasing bumpmapping og a brick texture. The 
light source shall be moving to make it easy to see that the 
bump effect works as intended.

###

Specular shading demo
Type: Feature

Implement a demo showcasing a specular shading of a 3D-model

###

Improve the error handeling
Type: Improvement

When failing to load an image/sound resource, improve the error
 message so it becomes easy to discover what caused the error.

###

Add unit tests
Type: Code quality

Add a testing framewor like googl-test. Do some basic unit test
on some apropiate and try to evaluate if they will improve the 
code quality. The test do not need to actualy test a big number
of classed. Just a test to see if it is worth while.

###

More ingame ambience
Type: Feature

There should be more ambienct sounds and perhaps music playing
in game to create a better atmosphere.

###

Add a minimap

Type: Feature

Create a minimap that shows the details of the world from above. This can
probably be acheived by rendering the world from above to a texture.

###

Player should make stepping sound when landing on the ground.

Type: Improvement

Currently the player makes stepping sounds when walking and when jumping.
It would feel more natural if it also made sounds when lading on the ground
after a jump/fall.

###

Build the game on windows

Type: Feature

Using Cmake to generate MinGW make files or maybe a code blocks project/
visual studio.

###

Sort chunks before rendering.

Type: Performance

Sort the chunks rendering order after the distance to the player. This way 
chunks that are father away and ocluded by another chunk will fail z-depth test 
and hence might improve performance since no shading is needed. Should bench 
mark this before using it.

###

Load generation options. Related to the xml Feature.

Type: Improvement

When creating a new map, the generations setting should be saved
and used when loading the same map. Currently when loading a 
saved map, the default settings will be used, wich might not be
the correct ones for theat map, causing inconsistent terrain
generation.

###

Save player location. Related to the xml Feature.
Type: Feature

When exeting a world the location of the player should also be
stored and used when loading the world again. The current chunk
that the player i located in should be used as the center next
time the world is loaded.

###

Reduce memory size on disk.

Type: Performance

Better way of storing chunks: Only store the dirrerence between the one 
generated by the seed when there are few differences. If the data needed to
store the difference is bigger than just storing all the data, the usual way
should be used.
