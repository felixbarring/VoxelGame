Step sounds
Type: Feature

When the player moves there shold be foot step sound played.
There should be a basic sound implemented, and possibility to
extend the feature to have different sounds depending on the 
material that the player is walking on. Some types of materials
could be: grass/dirt, stone/rock, wood.

Segfaults when the player moves between chunks. Some how an error causing
to many chunks to get removed by the chunkmanager. Bug is likely inside the 
chunkmanager.
