Collision response not accurate

The collision responce separates the player more than necessary. 
This will cause incorrect behaviour that will be more noticable 
at low fps. The solution should be to adjust the players speed 
so that he just gets very close, but not intersecting with any 
solid cube. 

###

Star night sky is broken:

The star sky does not work correctly, I get shader errors at the
time when it should be vissible.

###

The voxel lightning does not work correctly when loading a world.
The light does not spread correctly between chunks. Works fine
while playing, but not if the world is saved and  then loaded.

###

The shading between the voxels are not completly correct.

###

Graphical chunk not removed.

Some times the graphical chunks does not get removed when they 
should.
