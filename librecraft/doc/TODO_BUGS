###

Collision response not accurate

The collision responce separates the player more than necessary. 
This will cause incorrect behaviour that will be more noticable 
at low fps. The solution should be to adjust the players speed 
so that he just gets very close, but not intersecting with any 
solid cube. 

###

The voxel lightning does not work correctly when loading a world.
The light does not spread correctly between chunks. Works fine
while playing, but not if the world is saved and  then loaded.

###

The shading between the voxels are not completly correct.

###

AO is not completly correct

###

Various other lightning bugs

###

Graphical chunk not removed.

Some times the graphical chunks does not get removed when they 
should. 

###

When entering the ingame state, there is a chanse that the
shader becomes broken somehow and dont render correctly. 
Verry annoying, and hard to see how it happens since,
it occurs randomly. This only happens on intel, not NVIDIA.

###

When going back to the main menu from ingame, the music plays at 100% for a 
short moment and then starts from 0 to 100

###

Game crashes when removing cubes quickly, something agbout glm matrix.
only happens for light cubes it seems.

###

Games crashes directly after entering the ingame mode, segfault when trying
to access a cube. Has only happend once I think.
