These are things that can be added to the todo after 
being explained more thoroughly.

Prevent the game from crashing when the player is looking outside the worl,
that is, trying to access a cube not in range.

Game crashes when removing cubes quickly, something agbout glm matrix.
only happens for light cubes it seems.

Games crashes directly after entering the ingame mode, segfault when trying
to access a cube

Bunch of graphics buggs with light propagation when loading
a new world

Light propagate/depropagate is not correct for otherLight

Add Doxygen markdown files to each folder describing its purpose.
Also add a start page.

Slight lagg when loading new chunks

Build the game on windows

Add a feature so that a player can record how to build a house and then
create it in another place directly.

Move libnoise to a folder for src dependencies.

use xml to load/store settings

Fix more options being possible to change with both terminal and
settings

Moving sun on the sky

Fix so it is possible to change the markers position in the text
input

Fix so that the terminal can show all possible settings

Add cool post processing effects demo

Improve gui when world is dark

Sort the chunks rendering order after the distance to the
player. This way chunks that are father away and ocluded
by another chunk will fail z-depth test and hence might
improve performance since no shading is needed.
