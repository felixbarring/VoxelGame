These are things that can be added to the todo after 
being explained more thoroughly.

Graphical chunk usses a massive amount of memmory when creating the meshes.
About 2 gig when creating a small world. When the graphics are finished
the memory goes back to 2Mib wich is quite okay IMO.
Found this out by using valgrind massif. Need to fix this.

There might be some bad memory accesses. valgrind crashes when it is run
with player.updatePhisics()

Crashes when looking at bedrock

Better way of storing chunks: Only store the dirrerence between
the one generated by the seed.

Reduce the voxel size to 2 bytes

Game crashes whe ntrying to access history in terminal

Figure out a wasy of not storing air.

Only save chunks to file if they are modified from when they were generated.

TODO Fix memory usage. Memory usage is very high.

Water is rendered with strange light color some times

Game crashes when looking at bedrock, vector out of bounds...

Fix more options being possible to change with both terminal and
settings

Moving sun on the sky

Fix so it is possible to change the markers position in the text
input

Fix so that the terminal can show all possible settings

Add cool post processing effects demo

Improve gui when world is dark
