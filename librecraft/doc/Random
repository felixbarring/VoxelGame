These are things that can be added to the todod after 
being explained more thoroughly.

###

Add Doxygen markdown files to each folder describing its purpose.
Also add a start page.

Slight lagg when loading new chunks

Build the game on windows

Move libnoise to a folder for src dependencies.

use xml to load/store settings

Fix more options being possible to change with both terminal and
settings

Moving sun on the sky

Fix so it is possible to change the markers position in the text
input

Fix so that the terminal can show all possible settings

Add cool post processing effects demo

Refactor, use dependency injection

Improve gui when world is dark

Sometimes nothing is rendered when entering the game, 
broken shaders somehow

bunch of graphics buggs with light propagation when loading
a new world

Sort the chunks rendering order after the distance to the
player. This way chunks that are father away and ocluded
by another chunk will fail z-depth test and hence might
improve performance since no shading is needed.
